            </h1>
            <h3>If your baby is 3 years, here is a general checklist on what their progress should look like! At this age, consulting a doctor is recommended if your baby has 6 or fewer checks. Additionally, your baby is due for a checkup! According to the AAP, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that your baby is due for general developmental screening. Please check with your pediatrician or doctor regarding this. For more resources, check this link:
