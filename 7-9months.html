            <h4>If your baby is 7-9 months, here is a general checklist on what their progress should look like! At this age, consulting a doctor is recommended if your baby has 7 or fewer checks. Additionally, your baby is due for a checkup! According to the AAP, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that your baby is due for general developmental screening. Please check with your pediatrician or doctor regarding this.
